# Simplest Frame
## A zero-cost, zero-framework, dynamic Farcaster Frame template

### My needs for starting this were:
1. **Zero Framework:** Didn't want a framework baked in, and most options default to Next.js/React
2. **Zero Cost:** Frames are for experiments! Experimenting is more fruitful when it's free.
3. **Stable:** The domain and its attached state should be reasonably stable over the horizon of an experiment. Replit can only give you this at cost (see above)
4. **Dynamic Generation:** You can get all the above pretty easy with static files, but let's be real: we want dynamism!
5. **Cool Tech 😎:** We want to be at the 🤬 here, people!

### Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the Netlify CLI
3. `npm install`
4. `netlify dev`

### Caveats
I am a designer larping as a dev. I invite your collaboration and feedback. Please be kind.

And please! Can we make it simpler?

### Roadmap
1. Less bad
2. More better
3. Migration to the [everywhere.computer](https://everywhere.computer)
